# Line 'Em Up (Photography Web App)
## Determines optimal placement for large groups of people when photo time comes.

# Problem
---
If you are a photographer, you may know how daunting it is to take large group photos. It's not a matter of simply adjusting your camera's settings based on lighting and field of view.
The positioning of the group is just as important. Whether it be a football team or a graduating class, a good group photo usually has these 2 layouts: <br />
(1) Same number of people each row <br />
X-X-X-X-X-X <br />
-X-X-X-X-X-X <br />
X-X-X-X-X-X <br />
-X-X-X-X-X-X <br />
OR <br />
(2) Number of people each row alternates <br />
X-X-X-X-X-X <br />
-O-O-O-O-O- <br />
X-X-X-X-X-X <br />
-O-O-O-O-O- <br />

Ideally, each row would have a different elevation (provided by either stairsteps or bleachers).
It is also preferred that each row of people alternates a step so that each person's head is equally between the shoulders of the two people directly in the row behind them.

# Solution

This program. It serves to display the best symmetrical formation a given group of people can take.
Input: Total number of people in group <br />
Output: Patterns showing number of people in each row, ASCII representations of each pattern <br />
Ex: Input: 20 ... Output: 4 rows of 5 (each row is offset by 1 step) <br />
O-O-O-O-O <br />
-O-O-O-O-O <br />
O-O-O-O-O <br />
-O-O-O-O-O <br />
OR <br />
O-O-O-O <br />
-O-O-O-O <br />
O-O-O-O <br />
-O-O-O-O <br />
O-O-O-O <br />
